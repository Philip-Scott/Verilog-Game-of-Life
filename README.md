# Game of Life : Verilog Style
Simple Game of Life implementation done in verilog for the Basys 2 Spartan-3E FPGA. 


This project was done in collaboration with [GalaxiasKyklos](https://github.com/GalaxiasKyklos)

------------------------------------
The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. 
It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.[ยน](http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/)


### The Rules

For a space that is 'populated':
- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
  
For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
